A pluggable GeoDjango app with the boundaries of United States counties. Geography, loosely coupled.

h2. Requirements

Before you being, you will need to have a Django project with GeoDjango's 'django.contrib.gis' app installed and configured. The official installation guide is "here":http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/gis/install/. The official tutorial is "here":http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/gis/tutorial/. Both are excellent.

h2. Installation

*01. Install the source code*

You can download it from PyPi.
<pre><code>pip install latimes-pluggablemaps-uscounties</code></pre>

Or, pull the trunk from github
<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/datadesk/latimes-pluggablemaps-uscounties.git</code></pre>

*02. Install the app in your Django project*

In settings.py's INSTALLED_APPS tuple, add the following.
<pre><code>'us_counties',</code></pre>

*03. Create the database tables*

From the shell, enter:
<pre><code>python manage.py syncdb</code></pre>

*04. Load the data*

From the same shell, enter the following. Then go get a cup of coffee because this takes forever. Sorry about that.
<pre><code>python manage.py loaduscounties</code></pre>

*05. If you want to check out the demostration maps, install the urls*

In in your urls.py file's urlpatterns tuple, add the following.
<pre><code>(r'^us-counties/', include('us_counties.urls')),</code></pre>

h2. Version 1 Roadmap

# A speedier loader that does require a huge file download
# Unit tests
# help_text entries for the fields that define the different codes
# Figure out display names for functional status codes. Anyone know them?
